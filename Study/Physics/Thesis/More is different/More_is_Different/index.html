philosophers, but among the great majority of active scientists I think
it is accepted without question. The workings of our minds and bodies,
and of all the animate or inanimate matter of which we have any detailed
knowledge, are assumed to be controlled by the same set of fundamental
laws, which except under certain extreme conditions we feel we know
pretty well.</p>
<p>It seems inevitable to go on uncritically to what appears at first sight
to be an obvious corollary of reductionism: that if everything obeys the
same fundamental laws, then the only scientists who are studying
anything really fundamental are those who are working on those laws. In
practice, that amounts to some astrophysicists, some elementary particle
physicists, some logicians and other mathematicians, and few others.
This point of view, which is the main purpose of this article to oppose,
is expressed in a rather well-known passage by Weisskopf:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>Looking at the development of science in the Twentieth Century one can
distinguish two trends, which I will call "intensive" and
"extensive"research, lacking a better terminology. In short:
intensive research goes for the fundamental laws, extensive research
goes for the explanation of phenomena in terms of known fundamental
laws. As always, distinctions of this kind are not unambiguous, but
they are clear in most cases. Solid sate physics, plasma physics, and
perhaps also biology are extensive. High energy physics and a good
part of nuclear physics are intensive. There is always much less
intensive research going on than extensive. Once new fundamental laws
are discovered,a large and ever increasing activity begins in order to
apply the discoveries to hitherto unexplained phenomena. Thus there
are two dimensions to basic research. The frontier of science extends
all along a long line from the newest and most modern intensive
research, over the extensive research recently spawned by the
intensive research of yesterday, to the broad and well developed web
of extensive research activities based on intensive research of past
decades.</p>
</div>
<p>The effectiveness of this message may be indicated by the fact that I
heard it quoted recently by a leader in the field of materials science,
who urged the participants at a meeting dedicated to "fundamental
problems in condensed matter physics"to accept that there were few or
no such problems and that nothing was left but extensive science, which
he seemed to equate with device engineering.</p>
<p>The main fallacy in this kind of thinking is that the reductionist
hypothesis does not by any means imply a "constructionist"one: The
ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply
the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. In
fact, the more the elementary particle physicists tell us about the
nature of the fundamental laws, the les relevance they seem to have the
very real problems of the rest of science, much less to those of
society.</p>
<p>The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin
difficulties of scale and complexity. The behavior of large and complex
aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be
understood in terms of a simple extrapolation of the properties of a few
particles. Instead, at each level of complexity entirely new properties
appear, and the understanding of the new behaviors requires research
which I think is as fundamental in its nature as any other. That is, it
seems to me that one may array the sciences roughly linearly in a
hierarchy, according to the idea: The elementary entities of science X
obey the laws of science Y.</p>

<p>But this hierarchy does not imply that science X is "just applied Y".
At each stage entirely new laws, concepts, and generalizations are
necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a
degree as in the previous one. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is
biology applied chemistry.</p>
<p>In my own field of many-body physics, we are, perhaps, closer to our
fundamental, intensive underpinnings than in any other science in which
nontrivial complexities occur, and as a result we have begun to
formulate a general theory of just how this shift from quantitative to
qualitative differentiation takes place. This formulation, called the
theory of "broken symmetry,"may be of help in making more generally
clear the breakdown of the constructionist converse of reductionism. I
will give an elementary and incomplete explanation of these ideas, and
then go on to some more general speculative comments about analogies at
other levels and about similar phenomena.</p>
<p>Before beginning this I wish to sort out two possible sources of
misunderstanding. First, when I speak of scale change causing
fundamental change I do not mean the rather well-understood idea that
phenomena at a new scale may obey actually different fundamental
laws--as, for example, general relativity is required on the
cosmological scale and quantum mechanics on the atomic. I think it will
be accepted all ordinary matter obeys simple electrodynamics and quantum
theory, and that really covers most of what I shall discuss. (As I said,
we must all start with reductionism, which I fully accept.) A second
source of confusion may be the fact that the concept of broken symmetry
has been borrowed by the elementary particle physicists, but their use
of the term is strictly an analogy, whether a deep or a specious one
remaining to be understood.</p>
<p>Let me then start my discussion with an example on the simplest possible
level, a natural one for me because I worked with it when I was a
graduate student: the ammonia molecule. At that time everyone knew about
ammonia and used it to calibrate his theory or his apparatus, and I was
no exception. The chemists will tell you that ammonia "is"a triangular
pyramid with the nitrogen negatively charged and the hydrogens
positively</p>
<p>charged, so that it has an electric dipole moment (<span class="arithmatex">\(\mu\)</span>), negative
toward the apex of the pyramid. Now this seemed very strange to me,
because I was just being taught that nothing has an electric dipole
moment. The professor was really proving that no nucleus has a dipole
moment, because he was teaching nuclear physics, but as his arguments
were based on the symmetry of space and time they should have been
correct in general.</p>
<p>I soon learned that, in fact, they were correct (or perhaps it would be
more accurate to say not incorrect) because he had been careful to say
that no stationary state of a system (that is, one which does not change
in time) has an electric dipole moment. If ammonia starts out from the
above unsymmetrical state, it will not stay in it very long. By means of
quantum mechanical tunneling, the nitrogen can leak through the triangle
of hydrogens to the other side, turning the pyramid inside out, and, in
fact, it can do so very rapidly. This is the so-called "inversion,"
which occurs at frequency of about <span class="arithmatex">\(3\times 10^{10}\)</span> per second. A truly
stationary state can only be an equal superposition of the unsymmetrical
pyramid and its inverse. That mixture does not have a dipole moment. (I
warn the reader again that I am greatly oversimplifying and refer him to
the textbooks for details.)</p>
<p>I will not go through the proof, but the result is that the state of the
system, if it is to be stationary, must always have the same symmetry as
the laws of motion which govern it. A reason may be put very simply: In
quantum mechanics there is always a way, unless symmetry forbids, to get
from one state to another. Thus, if we start from any one unsymmetrical
state, the system will make transitions to others, so only by adding up
all the possible unsymmetrical states in a symmetrical way can we get a
stationary state. The symmetry involved in the case of ammonia is
parity, the equivalence of left- and right-handed ways of looking at
things. (The elementary particle experimentalists' discovery of certain
violations of parity is not relevant to this question; those effects are
too weak to affect ordinary matter.)</p>
<p>Having seen how the ammonia molecule satisfies our theorem that there is
no dipole moment, we may look into other cases and, in particular, study
progressively bigger systems to see whether the state and the symmetry
are always related. There are other similar pyramidal molecules, made of
heavier atoms. Hydrogen phosphide, <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{PH}_{3}\)</span>, which is twice as
heavy as ammonia, inverts, but at one-tenth the ammonia frequency.
Phosphorus trifluoride, <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathrm{PF}_{3}\)</span>, in which the much heavier
fluorine is substituted for hydrogen, is not observed to invert at a
measurable rate, although theoretically one can be sure that a state
prepared in one orientation would invert in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>We may then go on to more complicated molecules, such as sugar, with
about 40 atoms. For these it longer makes any sense to expect the
molecule to invert itself. Every sugar molecule made by a living
organism is spiral in the same sense, and they never invert, either by
quantum mechanical tunneling or even under thermal agitation at normal
temperatures. At this point we must forget about the possibility of
inversion and ignore the parity symmetry:the symmetry laws have been,
not repealed, but broken.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we synthesize our sugar molecules by a chemical
reaction more or less in thermal equilibrium, we will find that there
are not, on the average, more left- than right-handed ones or vice
versa. In the absence of anything more complicated than a collection of
free molecules, the symmetry laws are never broken, on the average. We
needed living matter to produce an actual unsymmetry in the populations.</p>
<p>In really large, but still inanimate, aggregates of atoms, quite a
different kind of broken symmetry can occur, again leading to a net
dipole moment or to a net optical rotating power, or both. Many crystals
have a net dipole moment in each elementary unit cell (pyroelectricity),
and in some this moment can be reversed by an electric field
(ferroelectricity). This asymmetry is a spontaneous effect of the
crystal's seeking its lowest energy state. Of course, the state with the
opposite moment also exists and has, by symmetry, just the same energy,
but the system is so large that no thermal or quantum mechanical force
can cause a conversion of one to the other in a finite time compared to,
say, the age of the universe.</p>
<p>There are at least three inferences to be drawn from this. One is that
symmetry is of great importance in physics. By symmetry we mean the
existence of different viewpoints from which the system appears the
same. It is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is
the study of symmetry. The first demonstration of the power of this idea
may have been by Newton, who may have asked himself the question: What
if the matter here in my hand obeys the same laws as that up in the
sky--that is, what if space and matter are homogeneous and isotropic?</p>
<p>The second inference is that the internal structure of a piece of matter
need not be symmetrical even if the total state of it is. I would
challenge you start from the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics and
predict the ammonia inversion and its easily observable properties
without going through the stage of using the unsymmetrical pyramidal
structure, even though no "state"ever has that structure. It is
fascinating that it was not until a couple of decades ago that nuclear
physicists stopped thinking of the nucleus as a featureless, symmetrical
little ball and realized that while it really never has a dipole moment,
it can become football-shaped or plate-shaped. This has observable
consequences in the reactions and excitation spectra that are studied in
nuclear physics, even though it is much more difficult to demonstrate
directly than the ammonia inversion. In my opinion, whether or not one
calls this intensive research, it is as fundamental in nature as many
things one might so label. But it needed no new knowledge of fundamental
laws and would have been extremely difficult to derive synthetically
from those laws; it was simply an inspiration, based, to be sure, on
everyday intuition, which suddenly fitted everything together.</p>
<p>The basic reason why this result would have been difficult to derive is
an important one for our further thinking. If the nucleus is
sufficiently small there is no real way to define its shape rigorously:
Three or four or ten particles whirling about each other do not define a
rotating "plate"or "football."It is only as the nucleus is
considered to be a many-body system--in what is often called the
<span class="arithmatex">\(N \to \infty\)</span> limit--that such behavior is rigorously definable. We say
to ourselves: A macroscopic body of that shape would have such-and-such
a spectrum of rotational and vibrational excitations, completely
different in nature from those which would characterize a featureless
system. When we see such a spectrum, even not so separated, and somewhat
imperfect, we recognize that the nucleus is, after all, not macroscopic;
it is merely approaching macroscopic behavior. Starting with the
fundamental laws and a computer, we would have to do two impossible
things--solve a problem with infinitely many bodies, and then apply the
result to a finite system--before we synthesized this behavior.</p>
<p>A third insight is that the state of a really big system does not at all
have to have the symmetry of the laws which govern it; in fact, it
usually has less symmetry. The outstanding example of this is the
crystal: Built from a substrate of atoms and space according to laws
which express the perfect homogeneity of space, the crystal suddenly and
unpredictably displays an entirely new and very beautiful symmetry. The
general rule, however, even in the case of the crystal, is that the
large system is less symmetrical than the underlying structure would
suggest: Symmetrical as it is, a crystal is less symmetrical than
perfect homogeneity.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the case of crystals this appears to be merely an exercise in
confusion. The regularity of crystals could be deduced semiempirically
in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century without any complicated reasoning at all. But
sometimes, as in the case of superconductivity, the new symmetry--now
called broken symmetry because the original symmetry is no longer
evident--may be of an entirely unexpected kind and extremely difficult
to visualize. In the case of superconductivity, 30 years elapsed between
the time when physicists were in possession of every fundamental law
necessary for explaining it and the time when it was actually done.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of superconductivity is the most spectacular example of
the broken symmetries which ordinary macroscopic bodies undergo, but it
is of course not the only one. Antiferromagnets, ferroelectrics, liquid
crystals, and matter in many other states obey certain rather general
scheme of rules and ideas, which some many-body theorists refer to under
the general heading of broken symmetry. I shall not further discuss the
history, but give a bibliography at the end of this article.</p>
<p>The essential idea is that in the so called <span class="arithmatex">\(N\to \infty\)</span>limit of large
systems (on our own, macroscopic scale) it is not only convenient but
essential to realize that matter will undergo mathematically sharp,
singular "phase transitions"to states in which the microscopic
symmetries, and even the microscopic equations of motion, are in a sense
violated. The symmetry leaves behind as its expression only certain
characteristic behaviors, for instance, long-wavelength vibrations, of
which the familiar example is sound waves; or the unusual macroscopic
conduction phenomena of the superconductor; or, in a very deep analogy,
the very rigidity of crystal lattices, and thus of most solid matter.
There is, of course, no question of the system's really violating, as
opposed to breaking, the symmetry of space and time, but because its
parts find it energetically more favorable to maintain certain fixed
relationships with each other, the symmetry allows only the body as a
whole to respond to external forces.</p>
<p>This leads to a "rigidity,"which is also an apt description of
superconductivity and superfluidity in spite of their apparent "fluid"
behavior. [In the former case, London noted this aspect very early.]
Actually, for a hypothetical gaseous but intelligent citizen of Jupiter
or of a hydrogen cloud somewhere in the galactic center, the properties
of ordinary crystals might well be a more baffling and intriguing puzzle
than those of superfluid helium.</p>
<p>I do not mean to give the impression that all is settled. For instance,
I think there are still fascinating questions of principle about glasses
and other amorphous phases, which may reveal even more complex types of
behavior. Nevertheless, the role of this type of broken symmetry in the
properties of inert but macroscopic material bodies is now understood,
at least in principle. In this case we can see how the whole becomes not
only more than but very different from the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>The next order of business logically is to ask whether an even more
complete destruction of the fundamental symmetries of space and time is
possible and whether new phenomena then arise, intrinsically different
from the "simple"phase transition representing a condensation into a
less symmetric state.</p>
<p>We have already excluded the apparently unsymmetric cases of liquids,
gases, and glasses. (In any real sense they are more symmetric.)It seems
to me that the next stage is to consider the system which is regular but
contains information. That is, it is regular in space in some sense so
that it can be "read out,"but it contains elements which can be varied
from one "cell"to the next. An obvious example is DNA; in everyday
life, a line of type or a movie film have the same structure. This type
of "information-bearing crystallinity"seems to be essential to life.
Whether the development of life requires any further breaking of
symmetry is by no means clear.</p>
<p>Keeping on with the attempt to characterize types of broken symmetry
which occur in living things, I find that at least one further
phenomenon seems to be identifiable and either universal or remarkably
common, namely, ordering (regularity or periodicity) in the time
dimension. A number of theories of life processes have appeared in which
regular pulsing in time plays an important role:theories of development,
of growth and growth limitation, and of the memory. Temporal regularity
is very commonly observed in living objects. I plays at least two kinds
of roles. First,most methods of extracting energy from the environment
in order to set up a continuing, quasi-stable process involve
time-periodic machines, such as oscillators and generators, and the
processes of life work in the same way. Second, temporal regularity is a
means of handling information, similar to information-bearing spatial
regularity. Human spoken language is an example, and it is noteworthy
that all computing machines use temporal pulsing. A possible third role
is suggested in some of the theories mentioned above: the use of phase
relationships of temporal pulses to handle information and control the
growth and development of cells and organisms.</p>
<p>In some sense, structure--functional structure in a teleological sense,
as opposed to mere crystalline shape--must also be considered a stage,
possibly intermediate between crystallinity and information strings, in
the hierarchy of broken symmetries.</p>
<p>To pile speculation on speculation, I would say that the next stage
could be hierarchy or specialization of function, or both. At some point
we have to stop talking about decreasing symmetry and start calling it
increasing complication. Thus, with increasing complication at each
stage, we go on up the hierarchy of sciences. We expect to encounter
fascinating and, I believe, very fundamental questions at each stage in
fitting together less complicated pieces into the more complicated
system and understanding the basically new types of behavior which can
result.</p>
<p>There may well be no useful parallel to be drawn between the way in
which complexity appears in the simplest cases of many-body theory and
chemistry and the way it appears in the truly complex cultural and
biological ones,except perhaps to say that, in general, the relationship
between the system and its parts is intellectually a one-way street.
Synthesis is expected to be all but impossible: analysis, on the other
hand, may be not only possible but fruitful in all kinds of ways:
Without an understanding of the broken symmetry in superconductivity,
for instance, Josephson would probably not have discovered his
effect.[Another name for the Josephson effect is "macroscopic
quantum-interference phenomena": interference effects observed between
macroscopic wave functions of electrons in superconductors, or of helium
atoms in superfluid liquid helium. These phenomena have already
enormously extended the accuracy of electromagnetic measurements, and
can be expected to play a great role in future computers, among other
possibilities, so that in the long run they may lead to some of the
major technological achievements of this decade.] For another example,
biology has certainly taken on al whole new aspect from the reduction of
genetics to biochemistry and biophysics, which will have untold
consequences. So it is not true, as a recent article would have it, that
we each should "cultivate our own valley, and not attempt to build roads
over the mountain ranges ... between the sciences."Rather, we should
recognize that such roads, while often the quickest shortcut to another
part of our own science, are not visible from the viewpoint of one
science alone.</p>
<p>The arrogance of the particle physicist and his intensive research may
be behind us (the discoverer of the positron said "the rest is
chemistry"), but we have yet to recover from that of some molecular
biologists, who seem determined to try to reduce everything about the
human organism to "only"chemistry, from the common cold and all mental
disease to the religious instinct. Surely there are more levels of
organization between human ethology and DNA than there are between DNA
and quantum electrodynamics, and each level can require a whole new
conceptual structure. In closing, I offer two examples from economics of
what I hope to have said. Marx said that quantitative differences become
qualitative ones, but a dialogue in Paris in the 1920's sums it up even
more clearly:</p>
<p>Fitzgerald: The rich are different from us.</p>
<p>Hemingway: Yes, they have more money.</p>
